# About Arkly
Arkly is a decentralized digital archives service for DWeb / Web3 platforms. 
Its primary function is to provide permanent document storage to blockchain applications that need persistent links to immutable off-chain files. 

## Background
The [Arkly.io](https://arkly.io/about/) concept is the outcome of several years of archival science [research and development](background.md) carried out by @peterVG.
