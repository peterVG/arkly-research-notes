# About Arkly
Arkly is a professional digital archives management service for decentralized platforms. It provides permanent document storage to blockchain applications that need persistent links to immutable off-chain files. 

The Arkly.io concept is the outcome of several years of archival science research and development carried out by @peterVG.
