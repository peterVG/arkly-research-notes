# Arkly background

The Arkly.io [concept](https://www.arkly.io/tag/features/) is the outcome of several years of archival science research and development carried out by @peterVG.

# How it started

## University of Amsterdam PhD thesis
2005 - University of Amsterdam PhD research question: Can the integration of institutional archival collections with personal digital archives create new or enhanced collective memories? If so, how?

2007 - Opening thesis chapters to define the domain of archives access systems
- [Archival materials: A practical definition](https://vangarderen.net/posts/archival-materials-a-practical-definition.html)
- [What is information anyway?](https://vangarderen.net/posts/what-is-information-anyway.html)

2005 - 2007 - Define requirements for institutional archives system. 

Create concept diagram to add in system requirements and software architecture decisions:
